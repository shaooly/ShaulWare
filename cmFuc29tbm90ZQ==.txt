What Happend to My Computer?
your important files have been encrypted using a millitary grade AES algorithm.
Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer 
accesible because they have been encrypted.
Maybe you are looking for a way to recover your files but do not waste your time.
Nobody, not your cousin, not your son who "Works in hightech" and not the 
computer repair guy. Nobody can recover your 
important documents other than our decryption service.

Why are we doing this?
We are all aware of the fact that thousands of people die and suffer
because they don't have enough money. We want to make the world a better place.
For you it might be just a couple bucks, or maybe a few minutes of your time,
but for the other person it could mean the world.
All we want for you is to do a good deed, and your files will return to you.
A good deed can be: paying for someone at the grocery store, buying a homeless
man some clothes and food, helping an old lady cross the street with her groceries.
As long as it can be documented with an image.

Can I recover my files?
Sure you can. We gurantee you can recover all your files safely and easily.
In order to recover your files you need to upload an image through
the button at the bottom of the screen to the server.
After you uploaded the files it will be checked by our team of
experts, who will make sure your image is valid. When your image
has been approved, your files will be safely returned to you,
and Our software will erase itself from your computer forever!


GOOD LUCK
