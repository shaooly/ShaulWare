What Happend to My Computer?
your important files have been encrypted using a millitary grade SHA256 algorithm.
Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer 
accesible because they have been encrypted.
Maybe you are looking for a way to recover your files but do not waste your time.
Nobody, not your cousin, not your son   who "Works in hightech" and not the 
computer repair guy. Nobody can recover your 
important documents other than our decryption service.

Can I recover my files?
Sure you can. We gurantee you can recover all your files safely and easily.
But, you don't have alot of time...
You have until the timer on the left side of the screen finishes to pay the ransom.
Once you send 400$ worth of bitcoin to the address on the bottom of the screen,
your files will be safely returned to you,
and Our software will erase itself from your computer forever!

How do I pay?
Payment will be recived only in bitcoin. Any other form of payment is NOT accepted.
If you wish to get your files back you should go buy bitcoin right now.
Buying bitcoin is easy and can be done through a number of online services available for you
all over the internet. Sites like Coinbase, Binance and more offer bitcoin purcheses with credit card.
Once you have transffered the bitcoin to the address you should get a transaction ID with your transfer.
Input the transaction ID to the specified box and click "Check Payment".
If your payment was succesfull, you files will be decrypted.
The transaction ID is case sensitive and if it has any spaces in it won't work.

GOOD LUCK
